# Panelized Structure Assembly & Animation Specification (Three.js)

## 1. Overview

This document defines the sequence and animation style for visually demonstrating the assembly of panelized building structures using Three.js, based on the Panel Paradigm concept. The goal is to create a dynamic animation showing components moving from an initial stack to form a complete structure.

## 2. Core Animation Concept

- **Initial State:** All necessary building components (foundation elements, wall panels, roof sections, windows, doors, etc.) are visually represented in a neat "delivery stack" or pile near the virtual build site (e.g., at coordinates relative to the foundation).
- **Assembly Animation:** Components animate sequentially from the stack to their final position in the structure, following the logical build order.
- **Completion:** A brief view of the fully assembled structure.
- **(Optional Phase 2):** Disassembly animation ("explosion" view) where components return to the stack.
- **(Optional Phase 2):** Cycling through different structure types.

## 3. Component Preparation (Three.js)

- **Geometry:** Procedurally generate Three.js geometry for each unique component based on provided plans/measurements.
- **Grouping/Hierarchy:** Use Three.js groups or parent-child relationships to manage components logically (e.g., group all back wall panels).
- **Origin Points:** Define consistent origin points for easy transformation (e.g., bottom-center for wall panels).
- **Initial Stack:** Position all component geometries in the initial "delivery stack" arrangement, typically in reverse assembly order (last items needed are on the bottom).

## 4. Animation Sequence & Style

This sequence uses the 10'x12' Studio Shed as a reference model but should be adaptable to other panelized structures.

### 4.1. Foundation (e.g., Frames 1-30)

- **Sequence:** Foundation elements (if applicable, e.g., skid foundation components or formwork outlines) appear and position correctly.
- **Animation:** Elements slide or fade into place. If simulating concrete, a mesh can grow to fill the foundation footprint.

### 4.2. Wall Panel Assembly (e.g., Frames 31-120)

- **Sequence:**
    1.  **Back Wall:** Panels animate from the stack to the back foundation edge, starting from one corner and proceeding sequentially.
    2.  **Side Walls:** Panels animate to connect to the back wall corners, ensuring correct overlap if specified (e.g., side walls overlapping front/back sill plates).
    3.  **Front Wall:** Panels animate last, completing the main wall structure. Include openings for doors/windows.
- **Animation Style:**
    - Panels "float" smoothly from the stack to their position.
    - Use ease-in/ease-out timing.
    - Add a slight overshoot or bounce upon settling.
    - Subtle rotation can be added during transit for visual interest.
    - Relative Timing: Side walls begin animating shortly after the first back wall panels are in place; the front wall begins after the side walls are largely positioned.

### 4.3. Window and Door Installation (e.g., Frames 121-180)

- **Sequence:** Window units and door units animate from the stack into their respective openings in the wall panels.
- **Animation Style:**
    - Similar floating motion as wall panels.
    - A slight "glint" effect can be added to glass surfaces as they move or settle.

### 4.4. Roof Construction (e.g., Frames 181-300)

- **Sequence:**
    1.  **Rafters/Trusses:** Outer/main roof structural elements (rafters, trusses) animate into position first, often starting from the back or one end.
    2.  **Intermediate Rafters/Purlins:** Fill in the remaining roof structure sequentially.
    3.  **Blocking/Supports:** Smaller blocking or support pieces animate into place between main structural elements.
    4.  **Connectors (Visual):** Small geometries representing brackets or ties can appear briefly at connection points.
    5.  **Sheathing/Decking:** Roof surface panels (e.g., OSB) animate onto the rafters, typically row by row from bottom to top.
- **Animation Style:** Similar smooth motion, potentially faster for smaller elements like blocking. Sheathing panels can slide or fade into place.

### 4.5. Roofing Installation (e.g., Frames 301-360)

- **Sequence:** Final roofing material (e.g., metal panels, shingles) animates onto the roof decking.
    - Metal panels typically install row by row, often starting from a back corner, with appropriate overlap.
- **Animation Style:**
    - Panels slide smoothly into place.
    - Small dots or simple geometries can briefly appear to represent fasteners.
    - Subtle changes in surface reflection as panels settle.

### 4.6. Interior Finishing (Optional - e.g., Frames 361+)

- **Sequence (Simplified):** If included, show insulation appearing within wall cavities, followed by interior wall surfaces (e.g., drywall panels) animating onto the studs.
- **Animation Style:** Insulation can "grow" or fade in; wall panels slide/fade into place.

## 5. Camera Movement

- **Start:** Wide establishing shot showing the build site and the initial component stack.
- **During Assembly:** Dynamically zoom, pan, and orbit to follow the current assembly action. Use close-ups for key connection points or details.
- **End:** Slow orbit around the completed structure.

## 6. General Animation Principles

- **Timing & Easing:** Use smooth easing functions (e.g., ease-in-out). Allow brief pauses between major phases (walls, roof, etc.).
- **Physics Feel:** While not a physics simulation, animations should have a sense of weight and momentum (slight overshoot, settle).
- **Visual Feedback:** Use subtle effects for emphasis (e.g., small particle puff on impact, brief highlight on fasteners).
- **Clarity:** Ensure the sequence is easy to follow and clearly demonstrates the construction logic.
