# Studio Shed Animation Sequence Rules

This file provides specific animation guidelines for assembling the 10'Ã—12' Signature Series Studio Shed in Blender.

## Animation Preparation
- Create collection groups for each major component type
- Use parent-child relationships to control hierarchy
- Set origin points consistently (bottom center for panels)
- Use custom properties to track assembly state

## Initial Component Stack
- Create "delivery pile" at (-5, -5, 0) relative to build site
- Stack components in reverse assembly order:
  1. Interior finishing materials (top of stack)
  2. Roof panels and metal roofing
  3. Window units
  4. Door unit
  5. Wall panels (organized by wall)
  6. Foundation materials (bottom of stack)

## Foundation Animation (Frames 1-30)
- Form boards appear and position
- Concrete "fills" the form from bottom to top
- Form boards remove after concrete cures

## Wall Assembly Animation (Frames 31-120)
```python
# Animation timing offsets per wall
back_wall_start = 31
left_wall_start = 61
right_wall_start = 76
front_wall_start = 91
```

- Back wall panels rise first and position
- Side walls follow, overlapping back wall at corners
- Front wall assembles last
- Panels should "float" up with slight physics follow-through
- Add subtle rotation as panels settle into position

## Window and Door Installation (Frames 121-180)
- Windows float from stack to openings
- Apply slight rotation during movement
- Door unit slides into position with slight bounce on settle
- Add glint effects to glass during installation

## Roof Construction (Frames 181-300)
- Outer rafter sections position first (frames 181-200)
- Intermediate rafters follow in sequence (frames 201-230)
- Blocking elements between rafters (frames 231-260)
- A23 brackets appear and connect components (frames 261-280)
- Roof sheathing lays down in sections (frames 281-300)

## Roofing Installation (Frames 301-360)
- Corrugated metal panels slide from back to front
- Each panel overlaps previous by 6" minimum
- Fasteners appear as small dots at installation points
- Add subtle reflection change as panels settle

## Interior Finishing (Frames 361-420)
- Electrical rough-in appears through walls (frames 361-380)
- Insulation fills wall cavities (frames 381-390)
- Drywall panels attach to walls (frames 391-410)
- Flooring material lays down last (frames 411-420)

## Camera Movement
- Begin with wide establishing shot showing component stack
- Zoom/pan to follow each major assembly step
- Include closeup details on key connections
- End with slow orbit of completed structure

## Timing and Easing
- Use ease-in for initial movement
- Slight overshoot at destination points
- Brief pause between major assembly phases
- Sync timing with appropriate sound effects

## Special Effects
- Add small dust/impact particles when panels connect
- Brief flash highlight for metal fasteners
- Subtle settling movements after major components placed
- Optional atmospheric elements (light breeze on trees)
