# Studio Shed Assembly Sequence

This file documents the precise assembly steps for building the 10'×12' Studio Shed Signature Series in Blender, following the manufacturer's guidelines.

## Pre-Assembly Preparation
1. Verify all components are available in the "materials stack"
2. Ensure foundation is level and properly positioned
3. Organize wall panels by type and position relative to final placement
4. Sort hardware by type and intended use point

## Wall Panel Assembly Sequence

### Step 1: Back Wall First
- Start at the higher back corner
- Stand and position first back wall panel
- Use shims if needed to ensure level
- Stand and loose-fit adjacent panels
- Do not fully secure until all back panels are positioned

### Step 2: Side Wall Connection
- Position rake wall (side wall) adjacent to back panel
- Ensure side walls overlap front and back sill plates
- Loose-fit panels to allow for adjustments
- Use clamps on top plates to aid alignment
- Verify corners are square before final attachment

### Step 3: Remaining Back and Side Walls
- Continue standing and positioning remaining panels
- Maintain the proper overlap at corners
- Use methods shown in Fig 5a-7a from assembly guide
- Add clamps to top plates for alignment
- Note that front and back top plates will overlap side walls

### Step 4: Front Wall Installation
- Begin with front-left panel for 36" door configuration
- Handle panels carefully to protect metal cladding
- Apply construction adhesive to window flanges as needed
- Continue with remaining front wall panels
- Install transom windows along top of front wall

## Window and Door Installation

### Step 1: Window Preparation
- Remove shipping blocks using T25 torxbit
- Cover screw holes with zip tape (except bottom flange)
- Apply adhesive to metal window flanges

### Step 2: Window Installation
- Install windows into prepared openings
- Secure according to manufacturer specs
- Verify operation of operable windows

### Step 3: Door Installation
- Position door unit in front wall opening
- Adjust for proper clearance
- Secure hinges and test operation

## Roof Construction

### Step 1: Outer Rafter Sections
- From the back, lift into place pre-assembled outer rafter sections
- Ensure outside face of blocking is flush with wall sheathing
- Verify longer rafter extension is on front of shed
- Bottom edge of blocking should be flush with metal cladding

### Step 2: Rafter Bracket Installation
- Install A23 brackets to top plates with 1.5" teco nails
- Start at front bracket and move toward back
- Do not nail down the bracket at back wall yet
- No A23 brackets needed along front wall

### Step 3: Intermediate Rafters
- Install intermediate rafter sections with equal spacing (~10.5")
- Sections may be single, double, or triple pre-assembled
- Follow methods for securing rafters from Fig 12b-13a

### Step 4: Rafter Blocking
- Add blocking between rafter sections using 2x material
- Cut blocking to fit (~10.5")
- Toe nail using framing nailer
- Add A23 brackets at back blocking
- Match angle of blocking to pre-assembled sections

### Step 5: Roof Tie Screws
- Install 6" rafter tie screws where rafters meet top plate
- Use metal guide for optimal 22.5° angle
- Follow Simpson installation guidelines

## Roofing Installation

### Step 1: Roof Underlayment
- Install roof underlayment working low to high
- Overlap each row 6" over lower row
- Use plastic cap nails to secure

### Step 2: Metal Roofing
- Start at back corner, working to opposite side
- Overlap panels by two peaks
- Use #12 × 3/4" neoprene washer screws
- Install one screw every 4 valleys (~12") along back edge
- Place screws in valleys where panels overlap
- Add next row overlapping previous by 6" minimum
- Align front edge and install screws
- Only use fasteners provided by Studio Shed

## Interior Finishing
- Install electrical conduit and outlets
- Add insulation between studs
- Attach drywall panels to interior walls
- Install flooring material
- Apply trim around windows and doors
- Complete interior finish details

## Final Inspection
- Verify all fasteners are properly installed
- Check window and door operation
- Ensure roof drainage is correct
- Test electrical systems
- Clean up construction materials
