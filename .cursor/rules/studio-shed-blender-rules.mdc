# Studio Shed Signature Series - Blender Construction Guide

This guide provides rules for constructing the Studio Shed Signature Series (10'D x 12'W) in Blender with proper dimensions and assembly steps.

## Overall Dimensions
- **Depth**: 10'0" (3.05m)
- **Width**: 12'0" (3.66m)
- **Max Height**: 9'3.5" (2.83m)
- **Front Wall Height**: 8'6" (2.59m)
- **Back Wall Height**: 7'3.5" (2.22m)
- **Roof Pitch**: 7°

## Foundation
- Create concrete slab: 12' × 10' × 6" thickness
- Position at world origin (0,0,0)
- Add slight texture with normal map
- Chamfer edges slightly (2mm bevel)

## Wall Structure
```python
# Wall panel dimensions
back_wall_dims = (3.66, 0.14, 2.22)  # 12' width × 5.5" thick × 7'3.5" height
front_wall_dims = (3.66, 0.14, 2.59)  # 12' width × 5.5" thick × 8'6" height
side_wall_dims = (3.05, 0.14, 2.40)   # 10' depth × 5.5" thick × average height
```

## Wall Components
- **Main Structure**: 2×4 wall construction (studs at 16" O.C.)
- **Sheathing**: 7/16" OSB on exterior
- **Siding**: Horizontal planks with 6" exposure
- **Interior**: 1/2" drywall panels
- **Insulation**: R21 between studs (if showing cutaway)

## Door and Windows
- **Front Door**: 72" × 80" centered on front wall
- **Clerestory Windows**: Span across front top 
- **Side Windows**: 36" × 36" standard size
- **Vistalite Window**: Full height on right side (approximately 24" × 84")

## Roof Construction
- **Rafters**: 2×6 at 24" on center
- **Overhang/Eaves**: 24" front, 18" sides and back
- **Roofing**: Corrugated metal with 6" minimum overlap
- **Roof Connections**: A23 brackets at key points

## Animation Sequence
1. Foundation appears first
2. Back wall panels rise from stack
3. Side walls connect to back (with side walls overlapping front/back sill plates)
4. Front wall panels with door opening
5. Windows insert into openings
6. Roof components: outside rafters first, then intermediate sections
7. Blocking between rafters
8. Roof metal panels from back to front
9. Interior finishing elements

## Material Setup
```python
# Example material creation
concrete = bpy.data.materials.new("Foundation")
concrete.diffuse_color = (0.7, 0.7, 0.7, 1.0)

wood_framing = bpy.data.materials.new("Framing")
wood_framing.diffuse_color = (0.8, 0.7, 0.5, 1.0)

metal_roof = bpy.data.materials.new("RoofMetal")
metal_roof.diffuse_color = (0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 1.0) 
metal_roof.metallic = 0.9
```

## Component Organization
- Create an "origin stack" outside the building footprint
- Group components by wall section for organized animation
- Use empties as control objects for sequential movement
- Maintain proper hierarchical relationships between parts

## Construction Details
- Wall panels connect with proper overlap (side walls overlap front/back)
- Roof panels install from back to front with proper overlapping
- Red-painted LVL top plates at specific locations
- T25 torxbit for removing shipping blocks from operable windows

## Visualization Options
- Complete model view
- Exploded view showing component relationships
- X-ray mode to reveal framing
- Step-by-step assembly animation
- Cutaway view showing interior features
