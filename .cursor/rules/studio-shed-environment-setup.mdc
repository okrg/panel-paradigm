# Studio Shed Environment & World Setup (Blender MCP)

This rule describes how to use Blender MCP to create a realistic environment and lighting for visualizing the Studio Shed construction site.

## World Environment
- Set the world background to a subtle sky gradient (light blue to white) for daylight realism.
- Add a ground plane:
  - Size: 60' x 60' (to provide ample context around the shed)
  - Material: Slightly rough, medium green (to simulate grass or turf)
  - Subdivide and add a subtle displacement for natural unevenness.
- Optionally, add a few low-poly trees or shrubs at the scene periphery for scale and realism.

## Lighting
- Add a Sun lamp:
  - Angle: 45° from above and front-right of the shed
  - Strength: 5.0
  - Color: Slightly warm (hex #fff6e5)
  - Enable soft shadows
- Add an HDRI environment texture for ambient light:
  - Use a clear sky or light cloud HDRI
  - Strength: 0.5–1.0
- Add a secondary fill light (Area or Point):
  - Position: Opposite the sun, low intensity (0.5–1.0)
  - Color: Cool white (hex #eaf6ff)

## Camera Setup
- Main camera:
  - Position: (20', -20', 12')
  - Target: Center of the foundation slab (6', 5', 3')
  - Focal length: 35mm
- Add a secondary camera for close-up and animation shots.

## Scene Organization
- Place all environment objects in a collection named `Environment`.
- Place all lighting objects in a collection named `Lighting`.
- Keep the world and environment setup separate from building components for easy toggling and rendering.

## Optional Enhancements
- Add a subtle fog effect for depth (World > Volume > Mist Pass)
- Add a background image or low-poly mountains for distant horizon
- Use Eevee or Cycles as the render engine, depending on performance needs
