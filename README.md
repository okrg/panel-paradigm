# Panel Paradigm Visual Experience

A self-contained, single-page web application that visually demonstrates the assembly process of our panelized building system using 3D animation. Built for easy embedding and extensibility.

## Features
- Animated 3D assembly and disassembly of multiple panelized structures
- Three.js-powered geometry and animation
- Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js for UI and interactivity
- Modular, embeddable container for future website integration
- (Advanced) Blender MCP integration for complex model workflows

## Tech Stack
- HTML, Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- (Optional) [Blender Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://mcpmarket.com/server/blender-model-context-protocol)

## Quick Start
1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/okrg/panel-paradigm.git
   cd panel-paradigm
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the local server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   # or use VSCode Live Server, then open index.html
   ```
4. **View in browser:**
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port shown in your terminal).

## Usage
- The main 3D experience is rendered in the container on the page.
- To add new structures, provide floor plans, elevations, and measurements. See `CLAUDE.md` for workflow details.
- For advanced modeling, see the [Blender MCP documentation](https://mcpmarket.com/server/blender-model-context-protocol).

## Contributing
- Open issues or pull requests for improvements, new features, or bug fixes.
